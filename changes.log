Version 0.5 Sat Aug 13 01:02:16 IST 2011
========================================

1) Assigned Cache-Control headers to all file types

   default is -  Cache-Control: max-age=172800, must-revalidate
   (172800 seconds = 2 days)

Version 0.4 Fri Jul  1 10:51:30 IST 2011
========================================

1) Catch the error and display message when access is denied to aws resource.
2) Bugfix: s3u config info - When printing the s3u config info
   using s3u -c, the backslash character for the allow rule
   to allow files without any extension (period '.').
   Since the entire info is in a string, any backslash character doesn't
   get printed.  So any backslash character should be escaped.
3) s3u config info: Added a deny rule to deny files ending in tilda '~'


Version 0.3 Thu Jun  9 17:07:16 IST 2011
========================================

   This can be done in the config file.  For more info: s3u -c
2) Version number is now read from version.rb.


Version 0.2 - Thu May 26
========================

1) Added a --debug switch for debugging info
2) Assigned content type - text/html for filenames that contain no period ('.')
   i.e. no filename extension.
3) Fixed a bug and added some regexp for the generated config file.
4) Added FAQ
